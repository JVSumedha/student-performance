# Predicting Student Academic Performance with Regression

This repository contains code and analysis for a project aimed at predicting student final grades (G3) based on a dataset of student attributes. The project utilizes a variety of regression models to explore and compare their effectiveness in predicting student performance.

**Project Goals:**

* To develop and evaluate regression models for predicting student final grades (G3).
* To compare the performance of different regression algorithms on this prediction task.
* To gain insights into the factors that influence student academic performance.

**Dataset:**

* The dataset used is "student-mat.csv," containing student demographic, social, and school-related features.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Data Exploration:**
    * Initial data loading and inspection.
    * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.
    * Visualization of numerical and categorical features.
    * Correlation analysis to identify influential features.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handling categorical features using Label Encoding.
    * Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
